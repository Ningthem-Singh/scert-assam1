                <h6>Objective :</h6>
                <p>
                    In today's digital world, delivery of information and services in a consistent, accurate and uniform
                    manner is critical to maintain transparency in governance. Information related to Teacher Education that
                    was available on the web was found limited largely to the functions of the institution, important
                    documents and details of officials. Issues related to the content, itâ€™s no availability; accuracy and
                    low level of intuitiveness were the major findings. The information that users looked for were generally
                    found lacking. This is a design for development of standardized, quality, informative, user-friendly
                    online portal to generate data-base with provision for regular updatation and grading of TEIs based on
                    certain vital phenomena as well as performance appraisal of individual teacher educator.
